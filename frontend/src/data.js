      "On Sept 10 & 11, we hosted a two day Artsfest Showcase + Market event held by Flaunt it Movement and Corner Commons. Here we took the opportunity to record a live episode on gentrification and its adverse effects on certain communities. This episode was recorded right in the middle of a neighbourhood that is currently being gentrified. This is a topic that needs more conversation and attention as it is destroying families and communities such as our very own, Jane and Finch. Big thank you to Flaunt it Movement and Corner Commons for the amazing opportunity to host and to talk BIG TINGZ !",
